# webpack-base
A webpack base for your project :sparkles:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install the package dependencies by running the following command

```
npm install
```
### Development

This will start a server, listening on connections from localhost on port 8080.

Now, when you change something in your assets, it should live-reload the files.

```
npm run start
```
## Build 

This will compile files in the dist folder.

```
npm run build
```
